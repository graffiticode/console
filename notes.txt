LAYOUT

An app is a network of pages that share a redux store. A page contains one or
more components. A component contains zero or more forms. Forms and their
containing components dispatch redux actions when those actions affect other
forms, or results in persistent state.

App
-- Page
---- Component
------ Form
---- Component
------ Form
------ Form

REDUX + GRAPHQL

State that is persistent or is compiled is sent to the graphql server. The
graphql resolver defines how the query (or mutation) is handled before any
state is stored.

redux dispatch -->
  redux thunk -->
    query -->
      compile? -->
        store?
        response -->
          redux dispatch -->
            react render

Generally, the values sent to the graphql server are actions. We can reused the
redux types and graphql typedefs to validate arguments passed and returned from
mutations and queries.
