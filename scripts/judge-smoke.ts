/**
 * Offline smoke test for the LLM-as-judge (src/lib/judge-service.ts).
 *
 * Exercises the judge END-TO-END with NO generation pipeline: no EVAL_API_KEY, no compile
 * server, no Firestore. It makes a few real judge calls (~a cent) against hardcoded
 * good/bad candidates and asserts the judge ranks them correctly and fails safe.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/judge-smoke.ts
 *
 * Exits non-zero on failure, so it's usable as a pre-commit / CI check. Needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
 * (from .env.local). This is the cheapest way to confirm the judge works before running the full
 * `model-eval --judge` sweep (which does require generation).
