/**
 * One-off: drop every cached L0177 spec so the next get_spec regenerates.
 *
 * The cache validates on {taskId, lang, model, version} — none of which move when a DIALECT's
 * prompt assets change, so a spec-directive or instructions edit leaves stale entries that would
 * be served indefinitely. SPEC_CACHE_VERSION is the global lever; this is the scoped one, for when
 * only one dialect moved and bumping the version would make every other language regenerate too.
