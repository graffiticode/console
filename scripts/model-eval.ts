/**
 * model-eval.ts — per-dialect, per-variant output-quality harness.
 *
 * Answers "which variant writes valid, first-shot code more often, and at what
 * cost/latency" for a dialect, so the family ordering in src/lib/model-priority.ts
 * is set from measurement rather than assumption.
 *
 * WHAT VARIES vs WHAT IS FROZEN — this is the whole design:
 *   - The VARIANT is a (model, effort) pair: `options.model` is pinned (which bypasses
 *     the language's family ordering and the fast-tier small-edit downgrade), and RAG
 *     retrieval runs ONCE per case and the identical `precomputedExamples` go to
 *     every variant.
 *   - `--models` moves the model with effort frozen (the original axis, and the default:
 *     with no `--efforts`, variantId IS the model id, so runs on disk stay comparable).
 *   - `--efforts low,medium,high` moves EFFORT with the model frozen — variantId becomes
 *     `<model>@<effort>`. Use it to answer "does thinking depth buy better code", which
 *     `npm run corpus-sweep` structurally cannot: the sweep compares each regeneration
 *     against the STORED corpus entry and its verdicts are match/structure, so a changed
 *     reasoning depth registers as a hit whether the new code is better, worse or equal
 *     — and it has no channel to report an improvement at all. Shape change is not
 *     quality. (This is why the 2026-09-04 "low broke 3 of 18 stably-matching prompts,
 *     zero improvements" result cannot settle the effort question; see model-priority.ts.)
 *   - Results are keyed on an opaque `variantId`, not on `model`, which is what let the
 *     second axis be a flag rather than a rewrite: case loader, trial runner, CIs, judge
 *     and calibration are all axis-agnostic and were not touched to add it.
 *
 * SIGNALS
 *   objective (free, deterministic, from generateCode's return):
 *     firstPassCompile = fixAttempts === 0 && compiled
 *     finalCompile     = compiled after error-correction
 *     drift            = compiled, but the wrong design (hooked langs only, e.g. L0175
 *                        asked for c1-t9 EBSR, emitted hot-text) — see driftedFromPrompt
 *     warnings         = what the compiler objected to, split fixable/unfixable by
 *                        scripts/eval-warning-taxonomy.ts
 *     fixRounds, latencyMs, cost (priced via src/lib/model-pricing.ts)
 *     agreement       = whether the variants wrote the SAME program on a case, at three levels
 *                       (layout / invented literals / shape) with a same-variant across-trials
 *                       control — see scripts/eval-code-agreement.ts. Free, from code already
 *                       retained, and the only objective signal left once compile rate saturates.
 *
 *   subjective (--judge, costs judge calls):
 *     pointwise 1-5 on the shared rubric; pairwise blind + order-controlled
 *     (both A/B orderings, must agree) round-robin over ALL variant pairs.
 *   cross-family trust (--panel):
 *     one judge PER FAMILY on every candidate, reporting agreement and
 *     SELF-PREFERENCE (each judge's own-family mean minus other-family mean).
 *     A Claude judge ranking Claude against GPT is grading its own family, so a
 *     single-judge cross-family ordering is not defensible. Required before
 *     committing a MODEL_PRIORITY line.
 *
 *     NOT required for an --efforts run: every arm is the same model in the same
 *     family, so there is no self-preference axis for a panel to expose. That drops
 *     the most expensive part of a model eval from the effort question.
 *
 * CONVERGENCE (--converge N) — the metric that matters for a dialect whose compile rate is
 * saturated. Compiling is table stakes; Graffiticode's actual advantage is that the compiler
 * talks back, so what distinguishes models is the item they reach after iterating and what that
 * iteration costs. A run becomes one AGENT SESSION: generate, then feed the compiler's own
 * warnings back (as an agent would through update_item) for up to N turns. Reports convergence
 * rate, turns-to-clean, residual warnings, per-turn defect buckets, and $/converged, with latency
 * and cost accumulated across the whole session.
 *
 * Without it, a variant that emits a mediocre item in one turn beats one that reaches a good item
 * in three — and a human labeling first-shot output would score them the same. The 0175 baseline
 * (2026-08-08) hit 100% compile, 0 stubs and 0 drift on all three variants while 35 of 60 compiles
 * carried warnings the harness never looked at; under --converge the same three separated at once.
 *
 * GATE: eval cases must not be in the RAG corpus (see scripts/eval-holdout.ts). A
 * leaked case grades every model on copying a retrieved answer, which flatters
 * whichever family mimics best — the exact axis being measured. The gate runs
 * before any spend and fails the run; --allow-leak downgrades it to a loud warning.
 *
 * PREREQS (prod env, like other scripts/):
 *   - .env.local: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY (generation, RAG, judges),
 *     Firebase creds, and EVAL_API_KEY (a DEDICATED eval account — generateCode
 *     writes usage records under its uid; keep it off real users).
 *   - api.graffiticode.org reachable (the compile step).
 *
 * EVAL SET: data/model-eval/<lang>.json = [{ id, prompt, currentCode? }].
 *   Seed from marks-3/4 training examples, but HOLD THEM OUT of RAG — the gate
 *   above enforces this rather than trusting it.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   npm run eval:holdout   -- --lang 0166              # gate only, free
 *   npm run eval           -- --lang 0166 --models claude-opus-5,gpt-5.6-sol --trials 3
 *   npm run eval           -- --lang 0175 --converge 5 # agent-session mode (see CONVERGENCE)
 *   npm run eval           -- --lang 0166 --panel      # + cross-family judge panel
 *   npm run eval           -- --lang 0179 --models claude-sonnet-5 --efforts low,medium,high --converge 5
 *                                                      # the EFFORT axis (see WHAT VARIES)
 *   npm run eval:calibrate -- --lang 0166              # judge vs human labels
 *
 * Output is timestamped by default (--no-stamp for a fixed path), so run-over-run
 * regressions are visible instead of clobbered.

/**
 * `design` is authored but not yet READ by this harness, and is here rather than in a sibling
 * README because it is part of a case's meaning.
 *
 * Two 0177-shaped checks need it, and neither can be derived after the fact:
 *   - Warning fixability is CASE-RELATIVE for a dialect whose docs say "do not invent `domain`,
 *     `user-id`, or `reference`". A hole for a value the prompt never supplied is unfixable BY
 *     DESIGN — the L0175 passage-level analog — so feeding it to the convergence loop asks the
 *     model to hallucinate a serving domain and scores every variant as never-converged. The same
 *     warning text for a value the prompt DID supply is a real defect. `supplies` is what separates
 *     them; see the fixable/unfixable split in scripts/eval-warning-taxonomy.ts.
 *   - Design capture / drift wants the intended view, and for this dialect the view IS the mode,
 *     so it is a one-token comparison rather than an embedding hook.
 * Recording it while authoring costs nothing; re-deriving it from prose later costs a re-read of
