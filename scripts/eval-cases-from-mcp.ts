/**
 * eval-cases-from-mcp.ts — author eval cases from a language's PUBLIC MCP surface, and only that.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   scripts/eval-holdout.ts keeps an eval case from BEING a training example. It cannot keep one
 *   from being a paraphrase of one. The corpus is dense, so a case seeded from marks-3/4 data and
 *   then reworded passes the gate clean while RAG still retrieves a near-answer for it — and the
 *   sweep partly measures which family copies a supplied solution best. That is the exact axis a
 *   family ordering is supposed to measure, so the contamination is directional, not noise.
 *
 *   The fix has to be at the source: author the cases from a surface that has never seen the
 *   corpus. `get_language_info` is that surface — the authoring guide, item types, scope, and
 *   example prompts an MCP agent gets before it writes its first request. Cases written from it
 *   are what a real caller would ask for, which makes them both independent AND more externally
 *   valid than corpus-derived ones.
 *
 *   Independence here is STRUCTURAL, not a promise: this file imports no Firestore client and no
 *   app module that reaches one. It cannot read `training_examples` even by mistake. Keep it that
 *   way — the moment this script can see the corpus, its output stops being evidence of anything.
 *   Measuring the result is a separate job (scripts/eval-case-proximity.ts), and measuring is fine;
 *   feeding the corpus back into AUTHORING is not.
 *
 * WHAT "THE MCP SURFACE" MEANS, EXACTLY
 *   One GraphQL query against the console API — the same one graffiticode-mcp-server issues in
 *   src/api.ts `getLanguageInfo`, which is what backs both `get_language_info` and the
 *   `graffiticode://language/L{id}/user-guide` resource. Fields used: authoringGuide,
 *   supportedItemTypes, scope, examplePrompts, usageGuide. If that query changes there, change it
 *   here; the point is that this script sees neither more nor less than an agent does.
 *
 * OUTPUT
 *   <out-dir>/<lang>.json            bare [{ id, prompt }] — the shape model-eval.ts loads
 *   <out-dir>/<lang>.provenance.json what it was authored from and by whom
 *
 *   The set goes in its own directory (default data/model-eval/mcp/) rather than replacing the
 *   corpus-seeded set, so the two can be run against each other. `loadCases` requires a bare
 *   array, which is why provenance is a sidecar rather than a wrapper object.
 *
 * CREATE CASES ONLY. Every case is a fresh authoring request with no `currentCode`. The update
 * path is unmeasured across every dialect and is worth fixing, but it is a different job: an
 * update case needs a believable prior program, and the only honest sources for one are a real
 * item or a generation — neither of which this script's independence rule allows it to reach.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   npm run eval:cases -- --lang 0176                 # 8 cases from L0176's MCP surface
 *   npm run eval:cases -- --lang 0176 --count 12
 *   npm run eval:cases -- --lang 0166 --out-dir data/model-eval/mcp
 *   npm run eval:cases -- --lang 0176 --dry-run       # print the surface + prompt, spend nothing
 *
 * Then gate and run it like any other set:
 *   npm run eval:holdout -- --lang 0176 --set-dir data/model-eval/mcp
 *   npm run eval -- --lang 0176 --set-dir data/model-eval/mcp --limit 8

/**
 * The authoring brief.
 *
 * Every rule here is one an existing set already follows implicitly; writing them down is what
 * makes the output reproducible rather than a matter of who ran it. The two that carry the most
 * weight:
 *
 *   - "supply the content" — a case that says "write an item about photosynthesis" measures the
 *     model's biology as much as its dialect. Handing over the stem, the key, and the distractors
 *     makes a failure attributable to the language, which is the only thing a family ordering can
 *     act on.
 *   - "do not reuse the example prompts' subject matter" — the example prompts are the one part of
 *     this surface a corpus example could plausibly resemble, since both describe the same feature
 *     set. Fresh subject matter is what keeps a generated case from landing on top of a corpus
 *     example by accident. scripts/eval-case-proximity.ts checks whether it worked.
