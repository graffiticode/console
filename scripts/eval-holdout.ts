/**
 * Hold-out preflight for the eval harness.
 *
 * `model-eval.ts` instructs that eval cases be seeded from marks-3/4 training
 * examples "but HOLD THEM OUT of RAG so you're not grading against retrieved
 * answers." Nothing enforced that, and the failure is silent and directional:
 * if a case is also a live `training_examples` doc, RAG retrieves the answer and
 * every model is scored partly on how well it copies a supplied solution. That
 * does not just add noise — it flatters whichever family is better at mimicry,
 * which is exactly the axis a family ordering is supposed to measure. Since the
 * ordering gets committed to src/lib/model-priority.ts and then decides real
 * traffic, a leak here becomes a durable wrong default.
 *
 * So this is a gate, not a warning: a leak fails the run.
 *
 * Escape hatch: --allow-leak downgrades it to a warning, for the case where you
 * deliberately want to measure retrieval-assisted performance. It prints loudly,
 * because that number must never be used to set a priority ordering.
