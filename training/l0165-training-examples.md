### Prompt
"create a five by five table with integer values of your choosing where every other cell is protected

now prefix all the values in the protected cells with a letter P

add validations for all the unprotected cells

excellent! now bold all the protected cells"

### Chat Transcript

**User**: create a five by five table with integer values of your choosing where every other cell is protected

**Assistant**: ```
This generated Graffiticode creates a spreadsheet-like grid with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains a number, and some of the cells are marked as "protected", meaning their values cannot be changed. The purpose of this generated code is to create a structured data layout that could be used for various applications, such as displaying numerical information in a tabular format.
```

**User**: now prefix all the values in the protected cells with a letter P

**Assistant**: ```
This generated Graffiticode creates a table with 5 columns and 5 rows. The table cells contain a mix of numbers and text, some of which are marked as "protected". The purpose of this generated code is likely to create a structured data layout, potentially for a spreadsheet or other tabular application.
```

**User**: add validations for all the unprotected cells

**Assistant**: ```
The generated code creates a grid-like structure with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains either a number that needs to be entered correctly, or a protected value that the user cannot modify. This code is likely part of an interactive learning or assessment tool, where the user is expected to input the correct values in the unprotected cells.
```

**User**: excellent! now bold all the protected cells

**Assistant**: ```
The generated code creates a grid-like structure with 5 columns and 5 rows. Each cell in the grid contains either a number or a protected label (e.g., "P12", "P19"). The numbers in the cells have associated "assess" attributes that specify the expected value for that cell, which could be used for some kind of assessment or evaluation.
