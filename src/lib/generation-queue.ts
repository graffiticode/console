// Enqueues async code-generation jobs onto a Cloud Tasks queue that calls the
// /api/generate-job worker. Cloud Tasks holds that HTTP request open while the
// 60-110s generation runs (CPU allocated the whole time, with retries), so the
// MCP-facing startCodeGeneration mutation can return immediately and clients
// poll get_item for completion. See src/pages/api/generate-job.ts.
//
// We call the Cloud Tasks REST API directly (fetch + metadata-server token)
// rather than @google-cloud/tasks: the SDK loads JSON/proto config files at
// runtime that Next.js standalone output-tracing doesn't bundle, which 500s the
// route. REST has no such footprint.
