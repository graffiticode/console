// read-and-verbalize, and few-shot exemplars bias toward an "average spec," risking elision of
// artifact-specific detail. Knowledge lives in two rule layers only: instructions.md (canonical
// language semantics, reused from the gen direction) and unparse-hints (node-local deltas).

/**
 * Ceiling, and no thinking. Both were set by measurement on L0177, the longest spec this produces.
 *
 * 8192 was silently truncating: a run used 7990 output tokens, 3451 of them thinking, and anything
 * that thought longer lost the tail of the document — including the entire Verification steps
 * section — while still looking like a complete recipe and being cached as one.
 *
 * Raising it to 24576 fixed that and broke something worse: thinking expanded to fill the room, a
 * generation took 82.7s, and `get_spec` is a SYNCHRONOUS call behind Cloudflare's 100s edge
 * timeout. Real callers got a 524 while the work completed and cached server-side — an error for
 * the agent, with the answer sitting in the cache it never saw.
 *
 * Measured 3 cases x {adaptive, disabled}, same prompt, scored on 12 content checks:
 *   adaptive   86.3s   7663 output tokens   33/36
 *   disabled   42.7s   3707 output tokens   33/36
 * Identical quality, half the wall-clock, half the tokens. That is unsurprising for this task —
 * spec generation is a constrained read-and-verbalize whose output is determined by the source
 * plus the directive, which is the same reason there is no RAG layer here. Thinking had room to
 * spend and nothing to buy.
 *
 * The one observed difference: a thinking-disabled run emitted `#` headings where the directive
 * asks for `##`. Cosmetic, and cheap at 44 seconds.

You are given the source of a Graffiticode item in its authoring dialect, annotated with

a precise, PLATFORM-NEUTRAL English specification.

Rules:
- Enumerate EVERY authored element. For an assessment: every question, and for each its stem,
  every option, the answer key, and any rationale. For a sheet: every populated cell and its
  formula. Apply the analogous completeness bar to whatever this dialect authors.
- Preserve exact authored text (passages, prompts, option text, labels) verbatim.
- Omit ONLY language-specific encoding, plumbing, internal field names, and IDs.
- Do not mention Graffiticode, the dialect, node tags, or that you are reading source.
- Output only the specification prose. No preamble, no code fences.
