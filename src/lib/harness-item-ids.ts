// Synthetic `itemId`s used by the internal generation harnesses.
//
// The daily corpus ping and the weekly corpus sweep both call
// `generateCodeForRequest` with an `itemId` they invent, because a dialect
// reading `get-val-public "itemId"` must resolve to something (see the comment
// at corpus-ping.ts's call site). Neither creates an item: the id is never
// written to Firestore.
//
// That is exactly what makes them dangerous to cost reporting. The id is
// CONSTANT per language, so anything that groups `ai_generation` records by
// `itemId` sees a whole window of harness runs as ONE enormous item. Observed
// 2026-09-09: L0175's 25 daily pings collapsed into a single $3.38 "item",
// which — averaged against the one real item the language produced that week —
// reported $1.62/item for a dialect whose real item cost 4 cents.
//
// So the ids live here, in one place, shared by the two writers and by every
// reader that has to tell harness traffic apart from customer traffic. A new
// harness MUST register its prefix here rather than inventing one at its call
// site, or it silently reappears in the cost reports as a giant fake item.
//
// Note these are *prefixes with a language suffix*, not opaque ids: matching is
// by prefix so `corpus-ping-0175` and any future `corpus-ping-0183` are both
// recognised without this file knowing the language set.
