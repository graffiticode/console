// Hourly funnel digest: read the period's MCP events out of Cloud Logging, roll
// them up, and render one SMS.
//
// SCOPE: MCP activity only, excluding our own accounts. The report answers "what
// did agents do over MCP", so console-surface authoring is filtered out at the
// reader (isMcpOrigin) and our dev/eval accounts with it (isExcludedAccount).
// It counted our own console work before, which is a demand signal that reads as
// real and isn't; a report you have to mentally subtract yourself from is worse
// than one that says zero.
//
// A scheduled PULL rather than a push pipeline. Every service already writes its
// events to Cloud Logging as JSON lines (console via src/lib/funnel-events.ts,
// mcp-service via its own src/events.ts, app.graffiticode.org for artifact
// views), so reading them back on a timer needs no log sink, no Pub/Sub topic,
// and no per-event alerting state. Cloud Scheduler runs it at :02 past each hour
// from 8am to 8pm PT — see src/pages/api/internal/funnel-digest.ts.
//
// We call the Logging REST API directly (fetch + metadata-server token) rather
// than @google-cloud/logging, for the reason documented on generation-queue.ts:
// the SDKs load runtime config that Next standalone output-tracing doesn't
// bundle, which 500s the route.
