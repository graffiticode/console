// Request-level code generation: the orchestration that turns ONE user request
// into a posted (possibly `+`-chained) task.
//
// This is the layer ABOVE the per-stage generator. `generateCode` in
// ../code-generation-service.ts generates a single language's program; this
// function owns everything around that — the scope gate, the reactive
// composition path and its permission fence, upstream generation, the atomic
// fallback, and stitching `head+s2+s3`.
//
// Composition here is REACTIVE, never planned: nothing decides to compose before
// the head is generated. The head's own instructions.md decides, by emitting
// `data use "<lang>"`; this module notices the binding after the parse and
// generates exactly those upstreams, if `composesWith` permits them. The
// pre-flight LLM planner that used to sit above generation (planSequence /
// planComposition / the L0010 planning-RAG) was removed on 2026-09-09: it ran on
// every fresh create whose head declared an edge, and its worst failure was
// silent to the head language — an upstream stage refusing the WHOLE request
// with its own `OUT_OF_SCOPE:` sentinel, so a user asking L0173 for a bar chart
// was told L0170 cannot draw charts.
//
// It lives here rather than in pages/api/resolvers.ts so that scripts, jobs and
// the GraphQL resolver all reach the SAME code path. When it lived in the
// resolver, scripts could only import the per-stage generator, so anything they
// produced was silently atomic — no plan, no upstream, no chain.
//
// IMPORTANT — do NOT re-export this from ../code-generation-service.ts or from a
// code-generation/index.ts barrel. language-router.ts imports
// code-generation-service, and this module imports language-router; routing the
// export through either of those recreates that cycle. Import the deep path.
