// existed, so it could only guess from catalog blurbs, and its failures were
// charged to the wrong language: an upstream stage refusing the whole request
// with its own `OUT_OF_SCOPE:` sentinel told a user who asked L0173 for a bar

/**
 * Split one user request into a per-stage prompt for each language in an already-decided
 * sequence.
 *
 * Every stage of a composition used to be generated from the ORIGINAL prompt verbatim, on the
 * theory that "content always comes from the original prompt; the sequence only fixes order."
 * That works until a dialect has a sharp scope boundary: an upstream then receives the host's
 * framing (a stem, difficulty tags, an answer key, a second unrelated question) and a dialect
 * whose instructions say "if the request is for one of these, say so instead of emitting a
 * program" refuses a request it was correctly chosen for. Telling the upstream to ignore the
 * noise treats the symptom; not sending it is the fix.
 *
 * This runs AFTER the head has already been generated: the sequence comes from the `data use`
 * bindings the head emitted, which carry lang ids and nothing else. The head keeps the original
 * prompt (it is the language the user chose, and on an edit only the verbatim request lines up
 * with currentCode); only the upstreams get a scoped share. One Haiku call, fail-open.
 *
 * FIDELITY IS THE WHOLE RISK HERE. A vague sub-prompt ("a spreadsheet with some test scores")
 * is WORSE than the noise it replaces: the noise made a stage refuse loudly, while a lossy
 * sub-prompt compiles clean and authors the wrong content. So the split is a PARTITION, not a
 * summary — every concrete value in the request must reach exactly one stage verbatim, and on
 * any doubt the caller falls back to the original prompt rather than a paraphrase.
 *
 * Returns null (caller uses the original prompt for every stage) on any failure, malformed
 * output, or length mismatch.

It will be built as a pipeline of ${sequence.length} stages, already decided:

${roster}

Write one prompt per stage, saying what THAT stage must author and nothing else.

Rules — the first is the one that matters:
1. PARTITION, DO NOT SUMMARIZE. Copy every concrete detail into the stage that owns it, VERBATIM: numbers, cell references, formulas, labels, option text, stems, tags, standards codes, answer keys. Never replace a value with a description of it — "85, 92, 78, 95, 88 in B2 through B6" must stay those digits and those cells, never "some test scores". If you cannot tell which stage owns a detail, put it in BOTH.
2. Each stage prompt must stand alone. It is read by a generator that sees ONLY that prompt — no other stage's text, no knowledge that a pipeline exists.
3. Give each stage only what its own description above says it authors. Do not hand a stage another stage's content.
4. Do not invent content the user did not ask for. If a stage's share is not described in the request, say plainly what little is known rather than inventing values.
5. Phrase each as a direct instruction ("Create ...", "Author ..."), not as a description of the request.
