// Turns one funnel window into a sentence about what MATTERS in it.
//
// The hourly SMS used to be raw facts — "15 anon calls / 2 workspaces · 3
// items". Every hour looked like every other hour, so reading it was work you
// had to do yourself: hold the last few messages in your head, notice that 3 is
// unusual, remember that codex-mcp-client had never appeared before. A number
// you have to diff by hand isn't a signal, it's a chore, and the reliable
// consequence of a chore arriving 13 times a day is that you stop reading it.
//
// So the counters still get computed exactly as before — aggregate() is
// untouched, the report page still renders every one of them — and this module
// sits between the digest and the phone, answering one question: is there
// anything here worth interrupting someone for, and if so, what.
//
// WHAT LEAVES THE MACHINE. The brief below is aggregate COUNTS plus client
// names, assembled from an already-aggregated Digest. It carries no prompt
// text, no session ids or namespaces, no tokens, no email, no IP — the digest
// pipeline never had those to begin with (see the privacy contract in the MCP
// server's src/events.ts), and buildBrief reads only counters. That is the
// property to preserve if this brief ever grows a field.
//
// FALLBACK IS THE POINT. narrate() returns null on every failure — no key, API
// down, timeout, truncated, empty, refusal — and the caller sends the
// deterministic formatSms() text instead. The send policy in funnel-digest.ts
// says every firing sends, so that silence means a broken cron; a narrator that
// could swallow a message would destroy that signal. It can degrade the message
// but it can never cost you one.

const SYSTEM = `You write one SMS line for the founder of Graffiticode, a platform that AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT/Codex, editors) connect to over MCP to build interactive content — assessments, spreadsheets, flashcards, diagrams.

You are given the aggregated counters for ONE time window, plus the same counters for recent prior windows as a baseline. Report the SIGNAL in this window: the thing, if any, that a person would want to know now, and could act on.

Rank what counts as signal, most important first:
1. A stranger got something finished — an item built, a trial claimed into an account. Someone who has never met you used the product successfully.
2. A first-ever: a client kind or a country never seen before. These are marked NEW in the brief; they are never marked twice.
3. A failure a real user hit — a generation failure, an item that failed to build, a language attempted but never built.
4. Volume plainly outside the baseline, in either direction, on strangers' activity.
5. Agent hosts that connected, took the catalog, and called nothing — but only if that number is unusual for the baseline.

Explicitly NOT signal, and never worth a sentence:
- Counts that sit inside the recent baseline. Ordinary is not news.
- Crawler and probe traffic. It is in the brief only so you can recognize it as noise.
- Signed-in activity, which is mostly the founder's own console work. Mention it only to say that it explains what would otherwise look like demand.
- A quiet window. Quiet is a fine answer.

Rules:
- Plain SMS text. No markdown, no emoji, no bullet points, no greeting, no sign-off, no link.
- Aim for under 160 characters. ${MAX_CHARS} is a hard ceiling and anything past it is cut off mid-word, so a message that tries to fit everything in loses its own ending.
- Report AT MOST TWO things, and rank ruthlessly. Every counter is one tap away on the report page linked under your line, so leaving something out costs nothing and running long costs the whole message. A window with five notable things still gets two sentences.
- Use only numbers that appear in the brief. Never estimate, extrapolate, or infer a number that is not there.
- Every counter in the brief is an independent total over the window. Never assert that two of them describe the same people, the same session, or the same event — the brief does not say who did what, and joining two lines yourself invents a fact.
- Say what happened, not what it might mean. You cannot see why anyone did anything, so do not guess at motives, intent, or causes.
- If nothing in the window clears the bar, reply with the word "quiet" and at most a few words of qualifier, e.g. "quiet — 1 workspace, nothing built".`;
