/**
 * Repairs the denormalized `users/{uid}.subscription` cache from Stripe.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Two paths answer "what plan is this account on", and they read different
 * sources:
 *
 *   - the billing UI (`/api/payments/usage`) queries Stripe LIVE, so it shows
 *     the true plan, included bucket, and billing period;
 *   - the enforcement gate (`checkItemCreateAllowed`) reads this Firestore
 *     cache, because it runs on every item create and must be fast and
 *     available even when Stripe is not.
 *
 * The cache is written by the Stripe webhook. When a delivery is missed — or an
 * upgrade happens outside the app — the two diverge, and the divergence is
 * silent and one-directional: the UI cheerfully reports "0 of 1,000 items used"
 * while the gate hard-blocks at the free plan's 50. A paying customer sees an
 * empty usage bar and cannot create anything.
 *
 * It compounds, because a missing subscription also costs the gate the billing
 * PERIOD: its usage self-heal falls back to the calendar month, so it recounts
 * items from a period the customer isn't in and confirms the wrong total.
 *
 * So a missing cache is not "this account is on the free plan". It is "we do not
 * know what plan this account is on" — and for a Stripe-linked account those are
 * very different answers. This repairs it on read: one Stripe lookup on a cache
 * miss, written back so subsequent creates are cache-only again.
 *
 * Deliberately mirrors the webhook's mapping (`priceIdToPlan`, the same period
 * helpers) so a repaired cache is byte-comparable with a webhook-written one; if
 * these two ever disagree, the account would flip plan depending on which wrote
 * last. `scripts/reconcile-subscriptions.ts` does the same job in bulk.
