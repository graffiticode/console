/**
 * LLM-as-judge — a single shared code-quality scorer, used two ways:
 *   - OFFLINE, in scripts/model-eval.ts: pairwise model comparison (win-rate) + per-run
 *     pointwise scores, so model/prompt changes can be judged above the (saturated) compile line.
 *   - INLINE (async), from generateCode: fire-and-forget after the response is returned, logging
 *     a pointwise score to rag_analytics/{requestId} with zero user-facing latency (JUDGE_MODE=async).
 *
 * One module so the rubric and prompt live in exactly one place — offline metrics and inline logs
 * are then directly comparable. Reference-free: the eval sets and live requests have no gold answer,
 * so the judge scores the candidate against the prompt (intent) alone, on three rubric dimensions.
 *
 * Provider-neutral: calls run through llm-generation-service's completeOnce, so the judge can be
 * an Anthropic OR an OpenAI model. That matters for cross-family comparison — a Claude judge scoring
 * Claude-vs-GPT output is grading its own family's work, so judgePanel (below) runs one judge per
 * family and the harness measures the disagreement rather than assuming it away.
 *
 * Imports llm-generation-service, not code-generation-service: the latter imports judgeCode, and
 * going through it would close a cycle. The tier/model tables live in llm-models, which is
 * cycle-free.

const RUBRIC = `You are a strict, discriminating judge of Graffiticode DSL code — a family of domain-specific
languages (spreadsheets, assessments, charts, …); each request targets one dialect. You are given the
natural-language request (the author's INTENT) and one or more candidate programs. There is NO
reference solution — judge each candidate on how well it realizes the intent.

Method — do this BEFORE scoring:
1. Enumerate the discrete requirements in the intent (each value, column, formula, condition, format).
2. For EACH requirement, verify whether the candidate satisfies it — trace the actual formulas and
   logic, do not assume. A well-formed formula that computes the wrong thing (wrong operand, wrong
   condition, wrong base, flat where tiered was asked, tax on the wrong subtotal, …) is a FAILURE.
3. The single worst material failure caps the score — correctness dominates presentation.

Scoring discipline:
- Compiling/rendering is table stakes, NOT quality. A program that renders but gets the central logic
  wrong is poor, not average — do not give credit for merely running.
- Do NOT default to high scores. Reserve the top score for candidates that are correct, complete, AND
  idiomatic. If any requirement is unmet or any formula is wrong, it is not a top score.
- Be concrete: name the specific requirement(s) missed or formula(s) wrong; only say "all requirements
  verified correct" when you have actually checked each one.

Score these dimensions, each an integer 1–5:
- correctness: is every value / formula / condition / structure actually right for the intent?
- instructionFollowing: is every requested element present, and nothing extraneous added?
- idiomaticity: clean, minimal, idiomatic Graffiticode for this dialect?`;
