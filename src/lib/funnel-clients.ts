// Which client kinds are prospects, which are machines, and which are us.
//
// A LEAF module on purpose: src/lib/funnel-digest.ts pulls in Firestore and a
// GCP token, and src/utils/db calls admin.initializeApp() at import time, so a
// script that imports the digest just to classify a name would initialise
// firebase-admin before setting GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS — and then throw
// app/duplicate-app on its own init. Nothing here imports anything.

/**
 * Which side of the noise line a client falls on — the ONE place that decides.
 *
 * `crawler` is a client that SAYS it is one — directory audits, reputation
 * scanners, uptime probes, `Mozilla/`-shaped user agents pasted into
 * clientInfo. `internal` is us exercising our own server (MCP Inspector is the
 * project's standard manual-testing app). Everything else that gives a name is
 * an `agent`, including names we suspect are automated: `Anthropic/ClaudeAI` is
 * far and away the largest bucket and has never produced a tool call, but
 * guessing it into the bin would delete the evidence either way. It gets its
 * own row, and the mcp_listed column settles it — a validator handshakes and
 * stops, a host lists our tools.
 *
 * `unnamed` is its own bucket rather than folded into `agent`. Connects carried
 * no client_kind until 2026-07-28, so merging them would invent demand out of
 * data that predates the field.
 *
 * This vocabulary lived in TWO places until 2026-08-26: here (reach rows only,
 * word-boundary matching) and as loose substrings in
 * scripts/mcp-funnel-report.ts, which used it to exclude probes from its
 * success rate. The digest's not having it is why the hourly SMS reported
 * `adoption-verify`'s 40 tool calls as anonymous demand in the 08-19→26 week —
 * 47 of 136 tool calls that week were probes. That script now imports from
 * here, so a name learned in one surface is known to all four.

 * matches an inspection-checklist authoring agent, which is a plausible thing
 * for someone to build on us.
 *
 * The `catalog-` and `orb-` PREFIX rules inherited from mcp-funnel-report are
 * deliberately not carried over: `catalog-shopping-helper` is a plausible real
 * client, and every prefixed name actually observed (`catalog-health`,
 * `catalog-inspect`) is covered by name or by a whole word. Nothing named
 * `orb-*` has ever connected, so the rule is dropped rather than guessed at.
